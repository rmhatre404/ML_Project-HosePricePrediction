        The objective of this project was to develop a machine learning model that could accurately predict house prices in Bangalore, India. The project utilized the Bangalore house price dataset obtained from Kaggle, which contained relevant information about various houses in the area.

     The project followed a systematic approach to building the prediction model. The dataset was first explored and preprocessed, including handling missing values, outlier detection, and feature engineering. Important features such as the number of bedrooms, square footage, location, and amenities were considered.After preprocessing, the dataset was split into training and testing sets to evaluate the performance of the model. Various regression algorithms were considered, including linear regression, decision trees and gradient boosting. The models were trained on the training set and evaluated using metrics such as mean squared error (MSE), root mean squared error (RMSE), and mean absolute error (MAE).
         Hyperparameter tuning was performed to optimize the model's performance. Techniques such as grid search optimization were employed to find the best combination of hyperparameters for the chosen algorithm.

        The trained model was then validated on the testing set to assess its performance on unseen data. The results indicated that the model achieved satisfactory accuracy in predicting house prices in Bangalore. The insights gained from the model can be valuable for potential buyers, sellers, and real estate professionals in making informed decisions regarding house prices.

           Overall, this project successfully demonstrated the application of machine learning techniques in predicting house prices. It highlights the importance of data preprocessing, feature engineering, model selection, and evaluation in building an accurate prediction model.
